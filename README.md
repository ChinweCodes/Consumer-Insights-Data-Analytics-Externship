# Consumer-Insights-Data-Analytics-Externship
As an extern in this program with Beats, my role was to help the company achieve its goal of understanding customer sentiments towards their products. My contributions will directly influence how Beats shapes its future strategies and product developments. A quick overview of what was expected of me:

- Use Python to mine customer reviews from Amazon and other review websites.
- Process the collected data to remove irrelevant details and errors, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
- Analyze patterns and trends in the data using statistical tools and visualizations to uncover initial insights.
- Employ artificial intelligence techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in the reviews, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral.
- Extract meaningful insights from the sentiment analysis to understand customer preferences and pain points.
- Compile all findings into a clear and concise presentation. Present these insights to the Beats team, highlighting key customer sentiments and potential improvements for products and services.
